// 1. What happens when you add a for loop/while loop/switch case block inside a function and use return instead of break?
// Do statements after the loop run? What is the return value? 
// Can we pass a return value from within a loop? ==> Yes
// Can you return from inside an if block? What impact does that have?

// What happens when you add a for loop/while loop/switch case block inside a function and use return instead of break?
// => break will just break the loop and execute the further code in the function while 
//    return will break the loop and will not be executing the further code in the function

// Can you return from inside an if block? What impact does that have?
// => Yes we can return from inside an if block. the further code will not be executed after return.
